A tool that aggregates all the reactjis from a Slack channel export and puts them into a nice graph. Mostly intended for project retros and general fun.

The initial data file is not included as it is a raw history of Slack channel messages. More documentation and examples are on the way.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
